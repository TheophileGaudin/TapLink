A 3dof browser I created in [November 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/RayNeo/comments/1ghqt8w/taplink_browse_the_internet_entirely_from_your/) for RayNeo X2. It works on Rayneo X3Pro too, though the port from InformalTech is more practical to use on these glasses.

The history of this development can be accessed in the [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/80GGhiEK).

I'll continue developments for my own needs and release a version for X3Pro. Once I put my hands on Inmo Air3 I'll develop a port towards it too. 
Feel free to contact me if you have any feature ideas. This browser was and will be community-driven. Its purpose is to be as convenient to use as possible from AR glasses.
