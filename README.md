A 3dof browser I created in [November 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/RayNeo/comments/1ghqt8w/taplink_browse_the_internet_entirely_from_your/) for RayNeo X2. It works on Rayneo X3Pro too.

Apk can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f-boxhhJZGgNInatY--o-o_nFf5nBQom/view?usp=sharing).

The history of this development can be accessed in the [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/80GGhiEK).

I'll continue developments for my own needs and release a version for X3Pro. Once I put my hands on Inmo Air3 I'll develop a port towards it too. 
Feel free to contact me if you have any feature ideas. This browser was and will be community-driven. Its purpose is to be as convenient to use as possible from AR glasses.
